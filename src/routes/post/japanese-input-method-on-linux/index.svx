# Introduction
So I've been learning Japanese lately then I came across this question, "How do I input a japanese character on my laptop?" I use a 12-keys layout to insert japanese characters on my phone. It takes time to adapt but eventually I got comfortable enough with it.

At first, I tried to change the keyboard layout but it doesn't work. I then came across this combination, **Fcitx** and **Mozc**. It's been a great experience using them, it's also very easy to set up and use.

# Fcitx
## What Is Fcitx?
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fcitx), **Fcitx** is an input method framework with extension support for the X Window System that supports multiple input method engines.

It supports multiple input engines like `fcitx-hangul` for Korean, `fcitx-mozc` for Japanese, `fcitx-googlepinyin` for Chinese, and more.

It also has a lot of addons that you can use like `clipboard` for clipboard management, `spell` for spellchecking, and many more.

## Installation
Installing Fcitx is pretty simple. It's available on most Linux distro official repository. I use Archlinux so mine will looks like this, you might use another distro but it's basically the same.

``` bash
# Arch
$ sudo pacman -S fcitx5 fcitx5-gtk fcitx5-qt fcitx5-configtool

# Fedora
$ sudo dnf install fcitx5 fcitx5-gtk fcitx5-qt fcitx5-configtool
```

> We're using Fcitx5 since it's the newer version of fcitx

After installing it, we need to set some variables for it to work.

## Configuration
To set our input method to `fcitx`, we need to change our environment variable.
I set it on `~/.profile`, but you can set it on `~/.xprofile`, `~/.pam_environment`, `~/.xinitrc` or anything that gets sourced on login. You ned to set these variables

- `~/.pam_environment`
    ```bash
    GTK_IM_MODULE DEFAULT=fcitx
    QT_IM_MODULE  DEFAULT=fcitx
    XMODIFIERS    DEFAULT=\@im=fcitx
    SDL_IM_MODULE DEFAULT=fcitx
    IBUS_USE_PORTAL=1
    ```

- `~/.profile` or anything that uses shell syntax
    ```bash
    export GLFW_IM_MODULE="ibus"
    export GTK_IM_MODULE="fcitx"
    export QT_IM_MODULE="fcitx"
    export XMODIFIERS="@im=fcitx"
    export SDL_IM_MODULE="fcitx"
    export IBUS_USE_PORTAL=1
    ```

# Mozc
## What Is Mozc?
According to the project [home page](https://github.com/google/mozc) itself, Mozc is a Japanese input method editor (IME) designed for multi-platform such as Android OS, Apple OS X, Chromium OS, GNU/Linux and Microsoft Windows. This OpenSource project originates from [Google Japanese Input](http://www.google.com/intl/ja/ime/).

We need this for `fcitx` that we've installed previously to be able to input Japanese characters.

## Installation
We are using Fcitx as our input method framework so what we need to install is `fcitx5-mozc`. It's also available on most Linux distro official repository.

``` bash
# Archlinux
$ sudo pacman -S fcitx5-mozc

# Fedora
$ sudo dnf install fcitx5-mozc
```

After installing it, it will be available to Fcitx as an input method.

## Configuration
Now what we need to do is set Mozc as Fcitx input method. To do that, open up the `fcitx5-configtool`. It will roughly look like this, it may look different because of your theme.

Make sure the checkbox for `Only Show Current Language` is unchecked, otherwise you won't find mozc.

![fcitx configtool](/assets/post/japanese-input-method-on-linux/configtool-2.png)

Find mozc, click it, then press the top button. Not sure why the icon is missing, probably some weird QT and GTK compatibility issue.

After clicking apply, execute `fcitx5` on startup depending on your DE/WM. I put it in `~/.xinitrc` like so.

``` bash
fcitx5 --replace -d &
```

If you put it on `~/.xinitrc`, it will get executed when you log in into xorg.

Fcitx is toggleable using a keybind that you can change from the `fcitx5-confgitool` which looks like this.

![fcitx configtool](/assets/post/japanese-input-method-on-linux/configtool-3.png)

You can change the `Trigger Input Method` to whatever key you like. I personally use `alt+space`.

## Usage
If you've done configuring it, try to activate it by pressing the keybind that you've defined before then try to type on something. It will look like this.

![fcitx completion preview](/assets/post/japanese-input-method-on-linux/preview.png)

It looks like an autocomplete from a text editor. The way it works is if you write `romaji`, it auto converts it to `hiragana` which you can then press `TAB` to scroll the options.

For example, if you write `watashi` then it will show `わたし` and if you continue pressing `TAB` it will be the kanji form of it which is `私`. This also applies to `katakana`.

# Closing Note
All in all, I'm pretty satisfied with this setup. I don't have to learn a new keyboard layout to insert Japanese characters. I can just write romaji and it will turn into hiragana, katakana, or kanji.

Anyway, thanks for reading this post. I hope you find this post useful and have a good day!
